# SlinGhost
## Summary

![slinghost_title_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fdb7ebe-a80b-4d85-982b-173d6d977592)

SlinGhost is an arcade shooter game with a physical installation, in which you have to shoot pumpkins with a giant slingshot at invisible ghosts, slowly coming towards you... before they reach you ! 

## Development

This project was realized by ENJMIN students in 5 days as part of a workshop on accessibility. The game was in fact, thought to be playable by people with visual or/and audio impairing disabilities.Visual, audio and haptic feedbacks allow the player to figure out the ghost's position. The physical crafted slingshot has an adjustable height,  allowing people in wheelchair to play, and a "one-button" mode (to facilitate inputs) has been prototyped but not fully developed.

NOTE : even though the game is downloadable and playable with mouse and keyboard, it was meant to be played using the homemade "giant slinghsot controller" the team crafted, exposed during a temporary event.
